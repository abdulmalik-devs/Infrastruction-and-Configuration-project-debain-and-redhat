Automating Web Server Provisioning with Ansible
=======================================

Objective:
-----------
In this project, you will create a Terraform script for provisioning Red Hat and Debian servers, along with an Ansible playbook to automate the provisioning process for these web servers. The goal is to deploy a Django web application on the Debian web server using Apache as the host server and deploy Node.js on the Red Hat web server using Nginx as the host server. The playbook will consist of two roles: "setup" and "deploy." The "setup" role will install Django, Apache, Python, Virtualenv, and other necessary dependencies on the Debian web server, and it will install Nginx, Node.js, Git, npm, and pm2 on the Red Hat web server. The "deploy" role will be responsible for deploying each web application to the respective web server and setting up all the necessary components to run the web applications.

SSH Key Authentication:
------------------------
Before running the playbook, ensure passwordless SSH authentication is set up between your local machine and the remote servers. This will allow Ansible to connect to the servers securely without requiring a password.

Playbook for Common Setup:
-----------------------------
To make the playbook more flexible and reusable, use Ansible variables to define values for application versions, web server ports, or any other application-specific configurations. This will allow you to easily modify the playbook for different scenarios.

Utilize Jinja2 templates within the playbook to dynamically generate configuration files based on the variables you define. This will enable you to customize the configuration files for each web server based on its specific requirements.

Roles:
-------
Organize your playbooks into roles. Create separate roles for common setup tasks, web server setup, and application deployment. This will make your playbooks more modular and easier to maintain.

Implement role dependencies, where appropriate, to ensure that common setup tasks are executed before deploying the web applications. This will help to avoid any conflicts or issues during the deployment process.

Handling Secrets:
-----------------
Use Ansible Vault to securely manage sensitive data, such as database passwords or API keys, within your playbooks. Ansible Vault provides encryption for sensitive data, ensuring that it remains secure and protected.

Extra Features (Optional):
-----------------------------
To enhance the functionality of your playbooks, consider implementing the following optional features:

1. Implement custom error handling and reporting in your playbooks to provide informative feedback in case of any errors or failures during the deployment process.

2. Create Ansible tags to allow selective playbook execution. Tags will enable you to run specific parts of the playbook or skip certain tasks, which can be useful for testing and debugging purposes.

3. Use Ansible's "wait_for" module to wait for services to become available before proceeding with the deployment. This can help ensure that the necessary services are up and running before deploying the web applications.

By following these guidelines and incorporating the optional features, you can create a robust and efficient Ansible playbook for automating web server provisioning and application deployment. Happy automating!

**Note:**
Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and access credentials before running the playbook on any production servers. Always test your playbook in a controlled environment before deploying it to a live system.
